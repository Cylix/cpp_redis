## [v3.4.0](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.4.0)
### Tag
`3.4.0`.
### Changes
* Change: update tacopie ref - IO Service is now based on `select` and not on `poll` anymore to solve some issues encountered on windows due to the buggy implementation of `poll` on windows Systems.
### Additions
None
### Removals
None



## [v3.3.0](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.3.0)
### Tag
`3.3.0`.
### Changes
* Rename `redis_client::before_callback` into `redis_client::set_callback_runner` which is more relevant.
* Before, `future_client` automatically called `.commit` when sending a command, meaning that no pipelining was done for the `future_client`. This has been changed and the `future_client` do not call `.commit` anymore: this is a **breaking** change and you **must** call `.commit` or `.sync_commit` when you wish the commands to be effectively sent. Please refer to the examples if necessary.
### Additions
* Add `commit` and `sync_commit` methodsto the `future_client` for pipelining support.
* documentation for `redis_client::before_callback` has been added
* documentation for `future_client` has been added
### Removals
None



## [v3.2.1](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.2.1)
### Tag
`3.2.1`.
### Changes
* Fix static initialization order fiasco condition
* Change `__CPP_REDIS_USE_TACOPIE` (cmake variable: `USE_TACOPIE`) into `__CPP_REDIS_USE_CUSTOM_TCP_CLIENT` (cmake variable: `USE_CUSTOM_TCP_CLIENT`). Of course, the meaning is now the opposite.
### Additions

### Removals

## [v3.2.0](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.2.0)
### Tag
`3.2.0`.
### Changes
* tacopie is no longer a mandatory dependency, but just provided by default and can be override if necessary.
### Additions
* add a new interface, `cpp_redis::network::tcp_client_iface` that allows you to use your own tcp_client in place of tacopie.
### Removals
* The `sync_client` has been removed as it was a duplicate of `redis_client::sync_commit` but with a different implementation based on futures. Please use `redis_client` and call `sync_commit` instead.



## [v3.1.2](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.1.2)
### Tag
`3.1.2`.
### Changes
* rename the `setbit()` function into `setbit_()` in order to avoid conflict with the standard library macro `setbit` causing compilation error.
### Additions
* add `send()` method to the `sync_client` and `future_client`.
### Removals
None



## [v3.1.1](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.1.1)
### Tag
`3.1.1`.
### Changes
